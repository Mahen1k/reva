# Agent environments from recorded captures

Use `rea environment-serve` to serve an environment manifest as an agent
environment: an MCP server whose tools answer from the records of one retained
web network capture, plus the environment card the agentenv framework reads to
discover it. Nothing is fetched from the recorded application; every answer is
retained Evidence.

```sh
rea inspect-web-network-capture /absolute/session.har har --format json > capture.json
rea inspect-analysis-view view.json --format json > manifest.json
rea environment-serve manifest.json --evidence capture.json --port 8765
```

The first command inspects the capture; the second projects the
[environment manifest](web-network-captures.md#environment-manifest) view from
it, where `view.json` wraps the capture Evidence as the inline source:

```json
{
  "source": { "kind": "inline", "evidence": { "evidence_id": "ev_…" } },
  "view": {
    "kind": "environment-manifest",
    "template_rules": ["after-uid-literal", "opaque-token", "sibling-variance"]
  }
}
```

The third command serves that manifest. Both served files are complete REA
Evidence JSON as the commands write it with `--format json`; the `evidence`
member of `view.json` is the whole of `capture.json`.

## What a manifest is

An environment manifest is a projection of one application's recorded request
lines into a tool surface: one tool per method and path template on the
primary origin, with inferred path parameters, observed query parameter
names, value-free body shapes and pointers to the parent records each tool
cites. It carries no bodies and no headers. The manifest's
`parent_evidence_id` names the capture Evidence it was projected from; the
serve command refuses a manifest whose parent is not the supplied `--evidence`
file with an `invalid_request` error naming both identifiers, so a manifest can
never be served from records it did not cite.

The MCP catalog and environment card sample path observations, request-body key descriptions and cited-record
lists within a 1 KiB UTF-8 budget per list. Oversized lists report how many
whole values are shown and point to the complete list in the manifest Evidence;
a captured path longer than 1 KiB is cut the same way in its tool description.
This only limits descriptive context, not arguments, record selection or replay.

## What replay means and does not mean

Each MCP tool call selects one of the records its manifest tool cites and
returns that record's recorded response. Selection compares the supplied path
parameters against the record's path segments at the parameter indexes, then
the supplied query values against the record's query string, and keeps the
record with the most matches; ties keep manifest order. The result reports
where the answer came from:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "content_type": "application/json",
  "body": { "id": 2, "login": "probe" },
  "replay": {
    "record_ordinal": 5,
    "evidence_id": "ev_…",
    "exact_match": true,
    "recorded_path": "/api/users/2",
    "recorded_query": null,
    "body_recorded": true,
    "body_encoding": "utf-8",
    "truncated": false
  }
}
```

`exact_match` is true when every supplied path parameter and query value
equals the recorded one; it says nothing about parameters the caller omitted.
A path value matches a recorded segment as written or after percent-decoding;
when both kinds of match are available, the record whose segment equals the
value as written is chosen.
When no record matches, the tool still answers from the tool's first cited
record and reports `exact_match: false`. `body` is parsed JSON when the
recorded content type is JSON-like (`application/json`, `application/*+json`,
`text/plain`, `text/markdown`) and the text parses without changing a number;
otherwise it is the recorded text, so a body with an integer outside
JavaScript's safe range (such as an id of `9007199254740993`) keeps its digits. Bodies over 256 KiB are cut at a UTF-8 boundary and returned as
text with `truncated: true`. `body_recorded` is false when the capture kept the
response's status and content type but no body; `body` is then `null`, which
is not a recorded JSON `null`. `body_encoding` is `base64` when the capture
retained response bytes that are not valid UTF-8; `body` is then exactly those
bytes in base64, never a lossy decoding. A retained base64 body is decoded only as far as the 256 KiB a reply can carry, and a leading byte-order mark is kept. For a `base64` body the limit applies to the recorded bytes, not their longer base64 spelling, and a cut keeps whole base64 groups. Request bodies passed to `POST`, `PUT` and `PATCH`
tools are accepted and ignored: nothing is written, and no call changes what a
later call returns. Arguments the tool's input schema does not name are
refused by the MCP server as invalid arguments, so a misspelled parameter never
degrades into an omitted one.

Replay is not emulation. A served environment does not establish the
application's authorization model, response semantics or state transitions,
which the manifest lists as unknowns; it does not validate supplied values; and
it does not answer requests the capture never recorded. Replayed content is
target content: every tool result, including the argument errors the MCP server
returns before a replay runs, carries `_meta.provenance.untrusted_content: true`
with `source: "analysis_target"`. The server advertises REA's untrusted-content
instructions plus a warning that its tool names, descriptions, parameter names
and observed values come from the capture too, and agents must treat all of it
as data, never as instructions.
That same warning prefixes every tool description in the standalone card, so
card discovery carries it before an MCP client initializes. It labels the
captured text without changing the tool names or schema fields clients use.

## Serve a manifest

```sh
rea environment-serve manifest.json --evidence capture.json [--host 127.0.0.1] [--port 0]
```

`--host` and `--port` default to `MCP_HOST` and `MCP_PORT` from the
environment, then to `127.0.0.1` and an ephemeral port, exactly as
[`rea mcp --http`](cli.md#serve-mcp-over-streamable-http) resolves them. The
bound MCP URL is written to stderr as one JSON log line
(`"msg":"MCP transport listening"` with `url`); `REA_LOG_LEVEL` overrides that
log level. `ENVIRONMENT_NAME` renames the served environment; otherwise the
manifest's `name` is used, and a set but blank value is refused as
`configuration_invalid` before binding rather than silently falling back. The
listener serves one MCP client at a time with the same session, `Host` header
and shutdown contract as [transports](mcp-contracts.md#transports) describes.
It runs until SIGINT or SIGTERM, then closes the listener, prints one
`{"status":"stopped", …}` document and exits `130` or `143`. A signal that
arrives while the files load ends startup with a `cancelled` result, and the same
exit status, before the listener binds.

Three routes are served:

| Route                             | Answer                                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /mcp`                       | The MCP server: one tool per manifest tool, replaying retained records |
| `GET /.well-known/agent-env.json` | The environment card                                                   |
| `POST /agentenv`                  | JSON-RPC `-32601 method not found: <method>` for every method          |

The data plane at `/agentenv` is advertised by the card but carries no
operations in this release; the error names the requested method so a caller
can see that the method, not the transport, is unsupported. Its request body is
read within the same 4 MiB bound the MCP endpoint applies: a larger body is
answered `413` with a JSON-RPC `-32000` error before any of it is parsed, and a
body that is not JSON is answered `400` with `-32700`. A notification (no `id`)
gets `202` and no body, a batch gets one reply per request in it, and an empty
batch, a batch of more than 100 messages, or a message that is not a JSON-RPC
request (including an `id` that is not a string, number or null, or `params`
that are not an object or array) gets `-32600 invalid request`.

## The environment card

The card is the discovery document the agentenv framework reads before
connecting to `/mcp`:

```json
{
  "name": "grafana-example",
  "protocolVersion": "1.0",
  "url": "/agentenv",
  "preferredTransport": "JSONRPC",
  "additionalInterfaces": [{ "url": "/mcp", "transport": "mcp" }],
  "capabilities": {
    "extensions": null,
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "get_users_by_id",
        "description": "GET /api/users/{numeric}; replays retained records [5, 6]; evidence ev_…",
        "inputSchema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "id": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "Path segment 2 (numeric); observed: 2, 3"
            }
          },
          "required": ["id"],
          "additionalProperties": false
        }
      }
    ],
    "operations": []
  },
  "children_environments": null
}
```

`capabilities.tools` lists the same names, descriptions and input schemas that
`tools/list` advertises over MCP. Path parameters are required strings whose
description names the segment index, the templating rule and the observed
values (sampled within the list budget above; the manifest keeps them all);
query parameter names are optional strings; write methods accept an
optional `body` object described by the recorded top-level key types. Each
input keeps its own argument: a query name equal to a path parameter's name is
advertised as `query_<name>`, and the write body as `request_body` when a query
parameter is named `body`. Every
schema closes with `additionalProperties: false`, a key the echo example's
schema does not carry.
`extensions`, `operations` and `children_environments` are fixed to `null`,
`[]` and `null`: a replay environment declares no extensions, no data-plane
operations and no children.

## Resource and lifecycle boundaries

Both Evidence files are read once at startup through the bounded JSON input
reader and authenticated as Evidence before the listener binds; a file that is
not Evidence, a manifest of another view kind, a capture of another format, or
a manifest projected from a different capture is refused before any port is
opened. Because authentication covers the capture's records, a manifest whose
parent check passes cites only records the capture retains. The server keeps
only the cited records' request lines and response text in memory. No outbound
network request is made, no process is launched and nothing is written to
disk. A listener that fails after binding is logged and ends the command with
a `resource_constraint` error and exit `1` instead of serving nothing.
